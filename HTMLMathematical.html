<strong>Linear Equations</strong>
<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
<div align="center"><mark>ax + b = 0</mark></div>
<pre>where <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are real numbers and <strong>x</strong> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <strong>x</strong>
so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <strong>x</strong> there.</pre>
<strong>Quadratic Equation</strong>
<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
<div align="center"><mark>  ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0  </mark></div>
<p>where <strong>a, b, c</strong> are known values and <strong>x</strong> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <strong>a</strong> can't be 0.</p>
<strong>The area of a circle (A)</strong>
<p><small><strong>&#960;</strong></small> (Pi) times the radius (<strong>r</strong>) squared:</p>
<div align="center"><mark>A = &#960; &#215; r<sup>2</sup></mark></div>
<p>or, when you know the diameter (<strong>D</strong>):</p>
<div align="center"><mark>A = (&#960; / 4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup></mark></div>
<p>or, when you know the circumference (<strong>C</strong>):</p>
<div align="center"><mark>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &#960;</mark></div>
<strong>Intersection</strong>
<pre>The intersection of two sets <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, denoted by A &#8745; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</pre>
<div align="center"><mark>  A &#8745; B = { x : x <small>&#8712;</small> A and x <small>&#8712;</small> B }</mark></div>
<p>That is, <strong>x</strong> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only if <strong>x</strong> is both an element of <strong>A</strong> and an element of <strong>B</strong>.</p>
